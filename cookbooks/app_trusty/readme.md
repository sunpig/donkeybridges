This cookbook is based on the principle, "choose a platform, and script the shit
out of it." It eschews community cookbook dependencies in favour of the basic
commands available in Chef itself. This makes for simpler installs, provided
you stick to the chosen platform.

The chosen platform is Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit server (trusty tahr). The recipes
have been tested on this, and nothing else.

If you want to change platform, you'll need to edit the recipes appropriately.
